##File Structure
    
Every question gets it's own folder.

Commit code in the format:

    [your name].[file type]
    
    eg.
    
    fred.py

If your name is taken, supply your second name.

For your JavaScript solutions remember to add your script to the "bin/javascript.html" if you want to test without Node. It would be good to output your solution to the console like so:

	console.log("[your name]:" + [output]);
  
*HAPPY CODING!*
