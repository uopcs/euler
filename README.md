##Rules

There Are No Rules!
    

Just Joking, Here Are The Rules:

    1. Please Abide By The Naming Conventions
    
    2. Don't Steal Other Peoples Code
    
    3. Don't Upload Code That Doesn't Produce The Correct Answer
    
    4. Don't Upload Code You Found On The Internet

##File Structure
    
Every question gets it's own folder.

Commit code in the format:

    [your name].[file type]
    
    eg.
    
    fred.py

If your name is taken, supply your second name.

For your JavaScript solutions remember to add your script to the "bin/javascript.html" if you want to test without Node. It would be good to output your solution to the console like so:

	console.log("[your name]:" + [output]);
  
*HAPPY CODING!*
