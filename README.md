Our solutions to the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler") problems.

## Rules

There are no rules!..

Just joking, here they are:

1. Don't steal others' code (this includes off of the Internet)
2. Please abide by the naming conventions
3. Try not to commit code that doesn't produce the correct answer

### Naming conventions
    
Every question gets it's own folder. Commit code in the format:

    [your name].[file type] (eg. fred.py)

If your name is taken, add your second name.

#### JavaScriptin'

For your JavaScript solutions you can use [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") or use the "bin/javascript/html" file.

It would be a good idea to output your solution to the console like so:

	console.log("[your name]:" + [output]);
  
*HAPPY CODING!*
